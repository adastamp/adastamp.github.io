I"ç<p>Today we got our first Community Advisor Assessments.
<a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383011">We got a whopping 4.5 out of 5.0</a>!</p>

<p>Advisors noted that it would be better to expand the grant scope to include all milestones - work to do for the <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396549">next stage</a>.</p>

<p>We are now working on improving the proposal.</p>
